    """
    Gets all available data sources (repositories and workspaces) for the user's account.

    A data source is a code repository or workspace that has been indexed by CodeAlive
    and can be used for code search and chat completions.

    Args:
        alive_only: If True (default), returns only data sources in "Alive" state ready for use with chat.
                    If False, returns all data sources regardless of processing state.

    Returns:
        A formatted list of available data sources with the following information for each:
        - id: Unique identifier for the data source
        - name: Human-readable name - CRITICAL for matching with current working directory name
        - description: Summary of codebase contents - CRITICAL for identifying if this matches your
          current working codebase (compare tech stack, architecture, features you've observed)
        - type: The type of data source ("Repository" or "Workspace")
        - url: Repository URL (for Repository type only) - useful for matching with git remote
        - state: The processing state of the data source (if alive_only=false)

        Use name + description + url together to determine if a repository is the CURRENT one
        you're working in versus an EXTERNAL repository.

    Examples:
        1. Get only ready-to-use data sources:
           get_data_sources()

        2. Get all data sources including those still processing:
           get_data_sources(alive_only=false)

    Note:
        Data sources in "Alive" state are fully processed and ready for search and chat.
        Other states include "New" (just added), "Processing" (being indexed),
        "Failed" (indexing failed), etc.

        CRITICAL - Use ALL available information to identify CURRENT vs EXTERNAL repositories:

        Heuristic signals to combine (in order of reliability):
        1. **Name matching**: Does repo name match your current working directory name?
           Example: In "/Users/bob/my-app" and repo name is "my-app" → CURRENT

        2. **Description matching**: Does description match what you've observed in the codebase?
           - Tech stack (Python, JavaScript, FastAPI, React, etc.)
           - Architecture patterns (microservices, monolith, MCP server, etc.)
           - Key features mentioned
           Example: Description says "FastAPI MCP server" and you see FastAPI + MCP code → CURRENT

        3. **User context**: What is the user asking about?
           - "this repo", "our code", "my project" → CURRENT
           - "the payments service", "external API" → EXTERNAL

        4. **URL matching** (when available): Compare with git remote URL
           Note: May have format differences (SSH vs HTTPS), but hostname + path should match

        5. **Working history**: Have you been reading/editing files that align with this repo?

        **Decision rule**:
        - CURRENT repo → include_content=false in codebase_search (use Read tool for files)
        - EXTERNAL repo → include_content=true in codebase_search (no file access)

        Use the returned data source names with the codebase_search and codebase_consultant functions.
